Staying productive as a developer can be challenging. Here’s how I manage my time and tasks:

1. **Plan My Day**  
   I use tools like Trello and Notion to plan tasks.

2. **Prioritize Deep Work**  
   Mornings are reserved for coding sprints without interruptions.

3. **Take Breaks**  
   A short walk or coffee break helps me stay focused.

4. **Reflect on Progress**  
   At the end of the day, I review what I’ve accomplished.
