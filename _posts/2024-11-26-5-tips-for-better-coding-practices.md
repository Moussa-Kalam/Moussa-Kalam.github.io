Good coding practices are essential for building maintainable and efficient software. Here are my top five tips:

1. **Write Readable Code**  
   Always aim for simplicity and clarity in your code.

2. **Comment Your Code**  
   Explain complex logic with concise comments.

3. **Use Version Control**  
   Git is your best friend. Commit often and write meaningful commit messages.

4. **Learn Testing**  
   Unit tests save you time debugging and ensure code reliability.

5. **Stay Updated**  
   Technology evolves quickly; keep learning and adapting.
